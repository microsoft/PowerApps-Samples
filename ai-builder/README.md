# AI Builder Samples

This topic provides information about the sample data files available in the **ai-builder** folder.

AI Builder documentation is available here: <https://docs.microsoft.com/ai-builder>

## Sample data for binary classification

To help you get started quickly with binary classification, use these three sample datasets. For information on how to import the sample data and use it in a binary classification model, see [Data Preparation](https://docs.microsoft.com/ai-builder/binary-classification-data-prep) in AI Builder docs.

Please note that you do not need to download the CSV files, but rather link the raw URL of the CSV files during the data import flow.
