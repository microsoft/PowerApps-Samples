# Canvas app dataset Power Apps component framework sample

This sample displays a paged, scrollable dataset grid that provides sortable and filterable columns. This sample allows the highlighting of specific rows by configuring an indicator column, which is a common request from app makers and can be complex to implement using native canvas app components. Code components can be written to work on both canvas and model-driven apps. However, this sample targets use within canvas apps.
