			"The code component displays a paged, scrollable dataset grid that provides sortable and filterable columns. It also allows the highlighting of specific rows by configuring an indicator column. This is a common request from app makers and can be complex to implement using native canvas app components. Code components can be written to work on both canvas and model-driven apps. However, this component is written to specifically target use within canvas apps."
