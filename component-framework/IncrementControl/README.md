# Increment Power Apps component framework sample

This sample shows how to bind data with the Power Apps component framework and error handling. This component renders as a textbox with an **Increment** button in the runtime. The text box shows the current value and the **Increment** button is clickable. Whenever you click on the button, the value within the textbox is increased by `1`. The increment value can be changed to any number you wish.
