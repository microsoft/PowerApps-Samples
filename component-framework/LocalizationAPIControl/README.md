# Localization Power Apps component framework sample

## Summary

This sample showcases how localization is done for code components. In this sample, we use the Increment component to localize the text that is displayed on the increment button based on the user's selected language.

Power Apps component framework uses the concept of implementing [RESX web resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/model-driven-apps/resx-web-resources) that are used to manage the localized strings shown on any user interface.
