## Prerequisites

[Install the Microsoft Power Platform CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/developer/cli/introduction)

## Try this sample component

Follow the steps in the [README.md](../README.md) to generate solutions containing the controls so you can import and try the sample components in your model-driven or canvas app.

**NOTE**

When you run try to run this sample using the test harness, you will get the following error:

```
Error occured during initilization of control: SampleNamespace.MultiSelectOptionSetControl;Message: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'forEach')
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'forEach') at multiSelectOptionSetControl.init
```

The reason is that the option set control data can't be simulated/mocked in the test harness. This sample will only run correctly when you configure it for a field in a model-driven app.
