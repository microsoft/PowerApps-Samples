# Customized editable grid Power Apps component framework sample

This sample demonstrates how to customize the Power Apps editable grid control as described in [Customize the editable grid control](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/component-framework/customize-editable-grid-control).

This sample changes the main grid page for a table that's configured to use this control, for example all text columns use green text. Any values for the `creditlimit` column displays as blue, if the value is greater than 100,000, or red otherwise.
