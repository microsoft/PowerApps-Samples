# Work with Discovery Service

This sample code shows how to use the discovery service with Dataverse ServiceClient.

## How to run this sample

You must first set the `username` and `password` variables in the `Program.Main` method of `Program.cs` before running this sample, because the sample doesn't open dialog to prompt you for connection information.

## What this sample does

This sample uses the [Microsoft.PowerPlatform.Dataverse.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.PowerPlatform.Dataverse.Client/) [ServiceClient Class](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.powerplatform.dataverse.client.serviceclient) to query the global discovery service with user credentials to determine which environments are their connected environments.

If one or more environments are returned, the sample prompts the user to choose one, and then uses a `WhoAmIRequest` to return the `SystemUser.UserId` for that environment.

## How this sample works

This sample simulates the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does).

### Setup

- This sample requires no special setup, other than the valid user credentials `username` and `password` you configure.
- You may need to update your project to the current .NET version with the [.NET Upgrade Assistant](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.upgradeassistant) extension. Once the extension is installed, right-click your project and select **Upgrade**.

In `Cloud.cs`, there's a `Cloud` enumeration for each of the known discovery regions. Each enumeration member is decorated with a `Description` notation. All members have the URL for the global discovery service for that cloud set as the description.

### Demonstrate

1. Using the user credentials and the `cloud` value, the program uses the `GetAllOrganizations` static method to retrieve all known environments for the user.
1. The `GetAllOrganizations` method extracts the data center global discovery service URL from the member `Description` decoration and uses it together with user credentials to execute the [ServiceClient.DiscoverOnlineOrganizationsAsync Method](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.powerplatform.dataverse.client.serviceclient.discoveronlineorganizationsasync) to retrieve the user's accessible environments.
1. If any environments are returned by the `GetAllOrganizations` method, they are listed in the console and you're prompted to choose one by typing a number. If your choice is valid, the selected [OrganizationDetail](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.discovery.organizationdetail) data is passed to the `ShowUserId` method that executes a `WhoAmIRequest` and displays the `SystemUser.UserId` for the user in that environment.

### Clean up

This sample creates no records. No cleanup is required.
