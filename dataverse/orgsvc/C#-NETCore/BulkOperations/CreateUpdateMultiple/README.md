# CreateUpdateMultiple README

This project uses the [CreateMultipleRequest](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.messages.createmultiplerequest) and [UpdateMultipleRequest](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.messages.updatemultiplerequest) classes to perform bulk create and update operations.

The project depends on the common structure for other projects in this solution as described in [CreateUpdateMultiple/README.md](../README.md).

This project sends only *two requests*. Each request attempts to complete operations for the total configured number of records.

You can expect this output for the project:

```output
