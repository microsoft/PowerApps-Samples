# Sample code design

Our .NET Core based code samples follow a certain design. This table highlights common design elements of a program's class members and how they are used.

|Member name|Purpose|
|--|--|
|Program()|Class constructor that reads the connection string value from the app settings JSON file. The code supports a global app settings file referred to by an environment variable. Otherwise, the app settings file included with the project is used.|
|Main()|Executes the Setup(), Run(), and Cleanup() methods (in that order).|
|Setup()|Pre-creates any entity or other data required by the Run() method. While this code may be interesting, the code is not the primary focus of the sample.|
|Run()|Invokes the primary operations being demonstrated by the code sample.|
|Cleanup()|Deletes all created entities and frees any other resources allocated during the execution of the program. Additonal overloaded Cleanup() methods may be added to the program to free additional non-entity related resources.|
|entityStore| Keeps track of all entities created in Dataverse by the sample. Used by Cleanup() to delete any created entities in Dataverse before the program terminates.|

We place any methods that demonstrate the primary purpose of the sample at the beginning of the code file to aid in discoverability. The code that follows is boilerplate (common among the samples) and often does not change.

## Data model

Some code samples use [early-bound](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/org-service/early-bound-programming#early-bound) entity types. You can find the generated data model code in the *DataModel* folder. This code was generated using the PAC CLI [pac modelbuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/developer/cli/reference/modelbuilder) command against a non-customized Dataverse environment.

## Templates

The code design described above is implemented in a Visual Studio project template that we use to create new code samples or migrate code from older samples. Feel free to use the template in your own projects.

Place the a copy of the template's compressed (.zip) file, located in the *Templates* folder, in your %USERPROFILE%\Documents\"Visual Studio 2022"\Templates\ProjectTemplates\C# folder so Visual Studio can find it. The name of the template used when creating a new project is "Dataverse SDK Console App (CSharp)".
