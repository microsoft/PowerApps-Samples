# Sample: Merge two record

This sample shows how to merge two record.

## How to run this sample

See [How to run samples](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/blob/master/dataverse/README.md) for information about how to run this sample.

## What this sample does

The `MergeRequest` message is intended to be used in a scenario where it contains the data that’s needed to merge the information from two table records of the same type.

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

### Setup

1. Checks for the current version of the org.
2. The `CreateRequiredRecords` method creates any table records that this sample requires.

### Demonstrate

1. The `MergeRequest` method creates the request. 
2. The `Account` message creates another account to hold new data to merge into the table.


### Clean up

Display an option to delete the sample data that is created in [Setup](#setup). The deletion is optional in case you want to examine the entities and data created by the sample. You can manually delete the records to achieve the same result.
