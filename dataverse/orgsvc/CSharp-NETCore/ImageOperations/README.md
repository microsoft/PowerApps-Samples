# Sample: Image Operations using Dataverse SDK for .NET

This .NET 6.0 sample demonstrates how to perform operations with image columns using the Dataverse SDK for .NET.

This sample uses the [Microsoft.PowerPlatform.Dataverse.Client.ServiceClient](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.powerplatform.dataverse.client.serviceclient).

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2022
- Access to Dataverse with system administrator or system customizer privileges

## How to run the sample

1. Clone or download the [PowerApps-Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples) repository.
1. Open the `PowerApps-Samples\dataverse\orgsvc\C#-NETCore\ImageOperations\ImageOperations.sln` file using Visual Studio 2022.
1. Edit the `appsettings.json` file. Set the connection string `Url` and `Username` parameters for your test environment.

   For example:

   ```json
   {
   "ConnectionStrings": {
       "default": "AuthType=OAuth;Url=https://myorg.crm.dynamics.com;Username=someone@myorg.onmicrosoft.com;Password=mypassword;RedirectUri=http://localhost;AppId=51f81489-12ee-4a9e-aaae-a2591f45987d;LoginPrompt=Auto"
     }
   }
   ```

   The environment Url can be found in the Power Platform admin center. It has the form `https://<environment-name>.crm.dynamics.com`.

1. Build the solution, and then run the project.

> [!TIP]
> You can set a user environment variable named `DATAVERSE_APPSETTINGS` to the file path of the `appsettings.json` file stored anywhere on your computer. The samples use the `appsettings.json` file if the environment variable exists and isn't null. Log out and back in again after you define the variable for it to take effect. You can manually set an environment variable by typing `env` in your system search bar, then choose **Environment variables** in the **System properties** window.

## Sample Output

The output of the sample should look similar to:

```

## Demonstrates

The code for this sample is in the [Program.cs](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/blob/master/dataverse/orgsvc/CSharp-NETCore/ImageOperations/Program.cs) file.

The project uses a `Utility` class to perform operations involving creating or retrieving schema data. This class is in the [Utility.cs](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/blob/master/dataverse/orgsvc/CSharp-NETCore/ImageOperations/Utility.cs) file.

This project performs these operations:

- [Create an image column](#create-an-image-column)
- [Create account records with image data](#create-account-records-with-image-data)
- [Retrieve the account records](#retrieve-the-account-records)
- [Download the account record images](#download-the-account-record-images)
- [Delete the image data](#delete-the-image-data)

### Create an image column

This sample needs to create a new image column that is the primary image for the account table. It must also return the system to the original state when it's finished. So these steps are performed:

1. Capture the original primary image name using the `Utility.GetTablePrimaryImageName` method.
1. Use the `Utility.CreateImageColumn` method to create a new image column named `sample_ImageColumn` on the account table if it doesn't exist already.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This image column `CanStoreFullImage` value is false.

1. Use the `Utility.SetTablePrimaryImageName` method to make `sample_ImageColumn` the primary image.

### Create account records with image data

1. The program loops through a list of five file names that match the names of files in the `Images` folder.
1. For each image, it creates an account record with the `name` set to `CanStoreFullImage false {fileName}` and the file `byte[]` set as the `sample_ImageColumn` value.
1. The program then uses the `Utility.UpdateCanStoreFullImage` method to set the `sample_ImageColumn` definition `CanStoreFullImage` value to true.
1. Again, the program loops through the file names and creates five account records with the same image files set to the `sample_ImageColumn` value. This time the `name` is set to: `CanStoreFullImage true {fileName}`.

In the following program, the value of the `CanStoreFullImage` property changes what data is available.

### Retrieve the account records

1. The program retrieves the 10 account records created in the previous step, including the image data.
1. For each account record, the image data is downloaded to the `DownloadedImages` folder with the name `{recordName}_retrieved.png`.

   > [!NOTE]
   > All records are thumbnail-sized images.

### Download the account record images

The program uses the static `DownloadFile` method, which encapsulates the
[InitializeFileBlocksDownloadRequest](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.crm.sdk.messages.initializefileblocksdownloadrequest)
and [DownloadBlockRequest](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.crm.sdk.messages.downloadblockrequest) classes to download the files.

> [!NOTE]
> Five out of ten operations are expected to fail because no full-sized images were uploaded while `CanStoreFullImage` was false. Those records created while `CanStoreFullImage` was true succeed.

### Delete the image data

1. The program deletes the image data for each account record by setting the `sample_ImageColumn` value to null and updating the record.
1. The program verifies the deletion by retrieving the records again using the same criteria as before. No value is returned for the `CanStoreFullImage` attribute because it's null.

### Clean up

To leave the system in the state before the sample ran, it does the following:

- Delete the account records
- Set the primary image back to the original
- Delete the image column
