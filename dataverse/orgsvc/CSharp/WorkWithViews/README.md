## How to run this sample

See [How to run this sample](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/blob/master/dataverse/README.md) for information about how to run this sample.

## What this sample does

This sample shows how to create a view and perform different actions on views.

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

### Setup

Checks for the current version of the org.

### Demonstrate

1. The `layoutXml` method creates the view that is required for the sample.
2. The `QueryExpression` message retrieves the views.

### Clean up

Displays an option to delete all the data created in the sample. The deletion is optional in case you want to examine the data created by the sample. You can manually delete the data to achieve same results.
