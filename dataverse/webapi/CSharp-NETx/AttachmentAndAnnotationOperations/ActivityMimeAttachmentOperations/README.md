# Web API Attachment (ActivityMimeAttachment) Operations sample

This .NET 6.0 sample demonstrates how to perform operations using file data with `ActivityMimeAttachment` (Attachment) table using the Dataverse Web API.

This project one of two projects included in the `AttachmentAndAnnotationOperations` solution, which provides shared resources to run either sample. See [Web API Attachment and Annotation Operations sample README](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/blob/master/dataverse/webapi/CSharp-NETx/AttachmentAndAnnotationOperations/README.md) for an overview and how to run this sample.

**Note**: This sample uses the common helper code in the [WebAPIService](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/dataverse/webapi/CSharp-NETx/WebAPIService) class library project.

## Demonstrates

The `ActivityMimeAttachmentOperations` project demonstrates:

- Adding attachments to an email record directly for single use. These attachment records will be deleted when the email is deleted.
- Adding attachments to an email template, then associating the attachment to an email. These attachments will not be deleted when the email is deleted.
- Setting the value of the `activitymimeattachment.body` property directly with a Base64 encoded string value. This is appropriate for small files.
- Using the following Dataverse Web API actions when working with `activitymimeattachment`, especially for large files.
   
   - [InitializeAttachmentBlocksUpload Action](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/initializeannotationblocksupload)
   - [UploadBlock Action](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/uploadblock)
   - [CommitAttachmentBlocksUpload Action](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/commitattachmentblocksupload)
   - [InitializeAttachmentBlocksDownload Action](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/initializeattachmentblocksdownload)
   - [DownloadBlock Action](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/downloadblock)
   
- Downloading the `activitymimeattachment.body` value and saving the file.


This sample uses classes defined for these actions within the [WebAPIService project Messages folder](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/dataverse/webapi/CSharp-NETx/WebAPIService/Messages) so that they can be re-used. These classes inherit from the .NET [HttpRequestMessage](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httprequestmessage?view=net-6.0) and [HttpResponseMessage](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpresponsemessage?view=net-6.0) classes. These classes have constructors that accept the relevant variables to compose the requests to send, or to deserialize the responses into standard properties.

The code for this sample is in the [Program.cs](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/blob/master/dataverse/webapi/CSharp-NETx/AttachmentAndAnnotationOperations/ActivityMimeAttachmentOperations/Program.cs) file.

## What does this sample do?

This sample uses three files to represent attachments:

|File|Size|Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|`WordDoc.docx`|18 KB|A small Word document.|
|`ExcelDoc.xlsx`|75 KB|A small Excel file.|
|`25mb.pdf`|25,265 KB|A large PDF file, which exceeds the default maximum file size of 5 MB.|

To upload the large file, the maximum file upload size must be increased. The `Utility.GetMaxUploadFileSize` function retrieves this value so it can be set back to the original value when the sample completes.

The sample is separated into two regions: **Create single-use attachments** and **Create re-usable attachments**.

### Create single-use attachments

1. Create an email activity.
1. Using only the small files, create two attachments associated to the email, setting the `activitymimeattachment.body` directly.
1. Use `Utility.SetMaxUploadFileSize` to increase the maximum file size for the environment to 131,072,000 Bytes (125 MB).
1. Use the static `UploadAttachment` method to create the attachment and upload the large file in chunks.
   
   The static `UploadAttachment` method encapsulates the use of these Web API actions:
   
   - [InitializeAttachmentBlocksUpload Action](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/initializeannotationblocksupload)
   - [UploadBlock Action](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/uploadblock)
   - [CommitAttachmentBlocksUpload Action](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/CommitAttachmentBlocksUpload)
   
1. Retrieve the `activitymimeattachmentid` and `filename` of the attachment records associated with the email using the `activity_pointer_activity_mime_attachment` collection-valued navigation property.
1. Use that data to download each attachment using the static `DownloadAttachment` method.
   
   The static `DownloadAttachment` method encapsulates the use of these Web API actions:
   
   - [InitializeAttachmentBlocksDownload Action](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/InitializeAttachmentBlocksDownload)
   - [DownloadBlock Action](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/DownloadBlock)
   
1. Download the large `25mb.pdf` file individually using `GET /activitymimeattachments(<activitymimeattachmentid>)/body/$value`. This returns a Base64 encoded string value that can be converted into `byte[]` and saved. 
   
   This is done using the [WebAPIService/Messages/DownloadAttachmentFileRequest](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/dataverse/webapi/CSharp-NETx/WebAPIService/Messages/DownloadAttachmentFileRequest.cs) and [WebAPIService/Messages/DownloadAttachmentFileResponse](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/dataverse/webapi/CSharp-NETx/WebAPIService/Messages/DownloadAttachmentFileResponse.cs) classes.
   
1. Delete the email activity. All the attachments are deleted with the email.

### Create re-usable attachments

1. Create an email template. This provides values to use when creating an `ActivityMimeAttachment` because `ObjectId` and `ObjectTypeCode` are required.
1. Attach all files as attachments using the `UploadAttachment` method described above.
1. Create a new email activity.
1. For each attachment created using the `UploadAttachment` method, create a new attachment associated with the email. Only set the `attachmentid` single-valued navigation property. Do not set the `body`, `filename`, or `mimetype`.
1. Delete the email activity.
1. Retrieve the attachments created using the `UploadAttachment` method to confirm that they still exist.
1. Delete the email template to clean up. This will delete the attachments associated with it

## Clean up

Use static `Utility.SetMaxUploadFileSize` method to set the maximum file upload size to the original setting.
