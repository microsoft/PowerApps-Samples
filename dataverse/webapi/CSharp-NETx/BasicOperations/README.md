## Demonstrates

This sample has 5 regions:

### Section 1: Basic Create and Update operations

Operations:
- Create a contact record.
- Update the contact record.
- Retrieve the contact record.
- Update a single property of the contact record.
- Retrieve a single property of the contact record.

### Section 2: Create record associated to another

Operations: Associate a new record to an existing one.

### Section 3: Create related entities

Operations: Create the following entries in one operation: an account, its associated primary contact, and open tasks for that contact.  These entity types have the following relationships:

```
Accounts
    |---[Primary] Contact (N-to-1)
        |---Tasks (1-to-N)
```

### Section 4: Associate and Disassociate entities

Operations:

- Add a contact to the account `contact_customer_accounts` collection.
- Remove a contact from the account `contact_customer_accounts` collection.
- Associate a security role to a user using the `systemuserroles_association` collection.
- Remove a security role for a user using the `systemuserroles_association` collection.

### Section 5: Delete sample entities

Operations: A reference to each record created in this sample was added to a list as it was created. This section loops through that list and deletes each record.

## Clean up

By default this sample will delete all the records created in it. If you want to view created records after the sample is completed, change the `deleteCreatedRecords` variable to `false` and you will be prompted to decide if you want to delete the records.
