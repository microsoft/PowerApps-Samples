# Sample: Image Operations using Dataverse Web API 

This .NET 6.0 sample demonstrates how to perform operations with image columns using the Dataverse Web API.

This sample uses the common helper code in the [WebAPIService class library (C#)](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/samples/webapiservice).

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2022
- Access to Dataverse with system administrator or system customizer privileges.

## How to run the sample

1. Clone or download the [PowerApps-Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples) repository.
1. Open the `PowerApps-Samples\dataverse\webapi\C#-NETx\ImageOperations\ImageOperations.sln` file using Visual Studio 2022.
1. Edit the `appsettings.json` file to set the following property values:

   |Property|Instructions  |
   |---------|---------|
   |`Url`|The Url for your environment. Replace the placeholder `https://yourorg.api.crm.dynamics.com` value with the value for your environment. See [View developer resources](../../view-download-developer-resources.md) to find this. |
   |`UserPrincipalName`|Replace the placeholder `you@yourorg.onmicrosoft.com` value with the UPN value you use to access the environment.|
   |`Password`|Replace the placeholder `yourPassword` value with the password you use.|

1. Save the `appsettings.json` file
1. Press F5 to run the sample.

```

## Demonstrates

The code for this sample is in the [Program.cs](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/blob/master/dataverse//webapi/C#-NETx/ImageOperations/Program.cs) file.

The project uses a `Utility` class to perform operations involving creating or retrieving schema data. This class is in the [Utility.cs](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/blob/master/dataverse/webapi/C#-NETx/ImageOperations/Utility.cs) file.

This project performs these operations:

### Create an image column

This sample needs to create a new image column that is the primary image for the account table. It must also return the system to the original state when it's finished. So the program does these things at the beginning:

1. Capture the original primary image name using the `Utility.GetTablePrimaryImageName` method.
1. Use the `Utility.CreateImageColumn` method to create a new image column named `sample_ImageColumn` on the account table if it doesn't exist already.

   > **Note:**
   > This image column `CanStoreFullImage` value is false.

1. Use the `Utility.SetTablePrimaryImageName` method to make the new `sample_ImageColumn` the primary image column.


### Create account records with image data

1. The program loops through a list of five filenames that match the names of files in the `Images` folder.
1. For each image, the program creates an account record with the `name` set to `CanStoreFullImage false {fileName}` and the file `byte[]` is set as the `sample_ImageColumn` value.
1. The program then uses the `Utility.UpdateCanStoreFullImage` method to set the `sample_ImageColumn` column definition `CanStoreFullImage` value to true.
1. Again, the program loops through the file names and creates five account records with the same image files set to the `sample_ImageColumn` value. This time the `name` is `CanStoreFullImage true {fileName}`

In the following code, we can see how the value of the `CanStoreFullImage` property changes what data is available.

### Retrieve the account records

1. The code retrieves the 10 account records created in the previous step, including the image data.
1. For each account record, the image data is downloaded to the `DownloadedImages` folder with the name `{recordName}_retrieved.png`.

   > **Note:**
   > All of these records are thumbnail-sized images.

### Download the account record images

This program uses three different methods to download image files.

> **Note:**
> In each case, 5 of the 10 operations will fail because no full-sized images were uploaded while `CanStoreFullImage` was false. Those records created while `CanStoreFullImage` was true succeed.

#### Download with Actions

The code uses the static `DownloadImageWithActions` method, which encapsulates the use of the 
[InitializeFileBlocksDownload](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/initializefileblocksdownload) and  
[DownloadBlock](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/downloadblock) actions to download the images as described in 
[Use Dataverse messages to download a file](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/file-column-data?tabs=webapi#use-dataverse-messages-to-download-a-file).

> **Note:**
> These operations fail when there's no full-sized image to download. The error message is: `No FileAttachment records found for imagedescriptorId: <guid> for image attribute: sample_imagecolumn of account record with id <guid>`.

#### Download with Chunks

The code uses the static `DownloadImageWithChunks` method, which demonstrates how to download images as described in 
[Download the file in chunks using Web API](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/file-column-data#download-the-file-in-chunks-using-web-api).

> **Note:**
> These operations don't fail when there's no full-sized image to download, they simply return `204 No Content`.

#### Download with Stream

The code uses the static `DownloadImageWithStream` method, which demonstrates how to download images as described in 
[Download a file in a single request using Web API](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/file-column-data#download-a-file-in-a-single-request-using-web-api)

> **Note:**
> These operations don't fail when there's no full-sized image to download, they simply return `204 No Content`.

### Delete the image data

1. The program uses three different methods to demonstrate deleting image values, using `PATCH`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.
1. The program verifies the records are deleted by retrieving the records again using the same criteria as before. The value for the image column is null.

### Clean up

To leave the system in the state before the sample ran, the program does the following:

- Delete the account records.
- Set the account table primary image back to the original value.
- Delete the image column.
