# Web API PowerShell Metadata operations sample

This PowerShell sample demonstrates how to work with the following using the Dataverse Web API:

- Table definitions
- Column definitions
- Option set definitions
- Relationship definitions
- Importing and exporting solutions

This sample uses the common helper libraries created as described in [Use PowerShell and Visual Studio Code with the Dataverse Web API](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/use-ps-and-vscode-web-api). These functions are defined in the [MetadataOperations.ps1](../MetadataOperations.ps1) file. You can find descriptions and examples in [Dataverse Web API PowerShell Helper Metadata operations](../README.md#metadata-operations-functions)

## Prerequisites

## Demonstrates

This sample has 11 regions:

### Section 0: Create Publisher and Solution

Operations: Create a solution record and an associated publisher record.

- After first checking whether these records already exist using the [Get-Records function](../README.md#get-records-function), the script creates them if they don't exist using the [New-Record function](../README.md#new-record-function). These functions are in the [TableOperations.ps1](../TableOperations.ps1) file.
- All solution components created in this sample will be associated to the solution so that they can be exported. This association is created using the `MSCRM.SolutionUniqueName` request header setting the solution unique name set as the value.
- All names of solution components are prefixed using the publisher customization prefix.
- Details about these records are added to the `$recordsToDelete` array so that they can be deleted later.

### Section 1: Create, Retrieve and Update Table

Operations:

- Check whether a `sample_BankAccount` table exists using the [Get-Tables function](../README.md#get-tables-function).
- If the column doesn't exist, create a new `sample_BankAccount` user-owned table using the [New-Table function](../README.md#new-table-function).
- Retrieve the created table using the [Get-Table function](../README.md#get-table-function).
- Update the table using the [Update-Table function](../README.md#update-table-function).

### Section 2: Create, Retrieve and Update Columns

Operations:

- Check whether a boolean column named `sample_Boolean` exists in the `sample_BankAccount` table using the [Get-TableColumns function](../README.md#get-tablecolumns-function).
- If the column doesn't exist, create a new boolean column for the `sample_BankAccount` table using the [New-Column function](../README.md#new-column-function).
- Retrieve the boolean column using the [Get-Column function](../README.md#get-column-function).
- Update the boolean column using the the [Update-Column function](../README.md#update-column-function).
- Update the option labels for the boolean column using the [Update-OptionValue function](../README.md#update-optionvalue-function).
- Query, create, and retrieve a new datetime column for the `sample_BankAccount` table using the `Get-TableColumns`, `New-Column`, and `Get-Column` functions.
- Query, create, and retrieve a new decimal column for the `sample_BankAccount` table.
- Query, create, and retrieve a new integer column for the `sample_BankAccount` table.
- Query, create, and retrieve a new memo column for the `sample_BankAccount` table.
- Query, create, and retrieve a new money column for the `sample_BankAccount` table.
- Query, create, and retrieve a new choice (`Picklist`) column for the `sample_BankAccount` table.
   - Add a new option to the choice column using the [New-OptionValue function](../README.md#new-optionvalue-function)
   - Change the order of the options of the choice column using the [Update-OptionsOrder function](../README.md#update-optionsorder-function).
   - Delete one of the options of the choice column using the [Remove-OptionValue function](../README.md#remove-optionvalue-function).
- Query, create, and retrieve a new choices (`MultiSelectPicklist`) column for the `sample_BankAccount` table.
- Query, create, and retrieve a new big int column for the `sample_BankAccount` table.
- Create a new Status option for the `sample_BankAccount` table using the [New-StatusOption function](../README.md#new-statusoption-function).

### Section 3: Create and use Global OptionSet

Operations:

- Check whether global choice already exists using the [Get-GlobalOptionSet function](../README.md#get-globaloptionset-function).
- If it doesn't exist, create a new global choice using the [New-GlobalOptionSet function](../README.md#new-globaloptionset-function).
- Retrieve the global choice using the [Get-GlobalOptionSet function](../README.md#get-globaloptionset-function)
- Create a new choice column for the `sample_BankAccount` table using the global choice using the `New-Column` function

### Section 4: Create Customer Relationship

Operations:

- Check whether a customer column exists using the `Get-TableColumns` function.
- If it doesn't exist, create a new customer column for the `sample_BankAccount` table using the [New-CustomerRelationship function](../README.md#new-customerrelationship-function).
- Retrieve the customer column using the `Get-Column` function
- Retrieve the relationships created for the customer column using the [Get-Relationship function](../README.md#get-relationship-function).

### Section 6: Create and retrieve a many-to-one relationship

Operations:

- Create a N:1 relationship between `sample_BankAccount` and `account` tables using the [New-Relationship function](../README.md#new-relationship-function).
- Retrieve the N:1 relationship using the [Get-Relationships function](../README.md#get-relationships-function)

### Section 7: Create and retrieve a many-to-many relationship

Operations:

- Verify that the `sample_BankAccount` and `contact` tables are eligible to participate in a N:N relationship using the [Get-CanManyToMany function](../README.md#get-canmanytomany-function)
- Verify that the `sample_BankAccount` and `contact` tables are eligible to participate in a N:N relationship using the [Get-ValidManyToManyTables function](../README.md#get-validmanytomanytables-function)
- Create a N:N relationship between `sample_BankAccount` and `contact` tables using the [New-Relationship function](../README.md#new-relationship-function)

### Section 8: Export managed solution

Operations: Export the solution containing the items created in this sample using the [Export-Solution function](../README.md#export-solution-function)

### Section 9: Delete sample records

Operations: A reference to each record created in this sample was added to a list as it was created. In this sample the records are deleted in the reverse order they were created using the [Remove-Record function](../README.md#remove-record-function)

### Section 10: Import and Delete managed solution

Operations:

- Import the solution exported in [Section 8](#section-8-export-managed-solution) using the [Import-Solution function](../README.md#import-solution-function)
- Query the solution table to get the id of the imported solution
- Delete the imported solution.

## Clean up

By default this sample will delete all the records created in it.

If you want to view created records after the sample is completed, change the `deleteCreatedRecords` variable to `false` and you will be prompted to decide if you want to delete the records.

**Note**: If you do not delete the un-managed solution components created by this sample, the code in [Section 10](#section-10-import-and-delete-managed-solution) will fail.
